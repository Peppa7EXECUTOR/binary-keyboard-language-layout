# Binary Keyboard Language Layout

A simple, fully developed keyboard layout that turns your normal keyboard into a binary typing machine. 

It started as a learning project, but i think someone would find it somewhat helpful or use it just for fun(games, chat, etc/).

##  How to start the program
- clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/Peppa7EXECUTOR/binary-keyboard-language-layout.git`
- **cd** to the directory(`binary-keyboard-language-layout`)
- Install dependencies: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
-  After this, run:
`python binary_keyboard.py`

# Functionality 
- When **F1** is pressed, the program stops
- When **F3** is pressed, the program pauses/continues

Note: The terminal window is not closed automatically. This is expected behavior. The **'os' library** could be added.
